    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    
    <p></p>
    
    <p>Traditional Feature Detectors and Trackers use information aggregation in 2D patches to detect and match discriminative patches.  However, this information does not remain the same at object boundaries when there is object motion against a significantly varying background.  In this paper, we propose a new approach for feature detection, tracking and re-detection that gives significantly improved results at the object boundaries.  We utilize {\em level lines} or {\em iso-intensity curves} that often remain stable and can be reliably 
detected even at the object boundaries, which they often trace.
Stable portions of long level lines are detected and points of high curvature  are detected on such curves for corner detection.   
Further, this level line  
is used to separate the portions belonging to the two objects, which is then used for robust matching of such points.  While such CoMaL (Corners on 
Maximally-stable Level Line Segments) points were found to be much more reliable at the object boundary
regions, they perform 
comparably at the interior regions as well. This is illustrated in exhaustive experiments 
% for point tracking applications on benchmark tracking datasets.
on real-world datasets.
