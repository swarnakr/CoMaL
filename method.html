    <p>Traditional Feature Detectors and Trackers use information aggregation in 2D patches to detect and match discriminative patches.  However, this information does not remain the same at object boundaries when there is object motion against a significantly varying background.  In this paper, we propose a new approach for feature detection, tracking and re-detection that gives significantly improved results at the object boundaries.  We utilize {\em level lines} or {\em iso-intensity curves} that often remain stable and can be reliably 
detected even at the object boundaries, which they often trace.
Stable portions of long level lines are detected and points of high curvature  are detected on such curves for corner detection.   
Further, this level line  
is used to separate the portions belonging to the two objects, which is then used for robust matching of such points.  While such CoMaL (Corners on 
Maximally-stable Level Line Segments) points were found to be much more reliable at the object boundary
regions, they perform 
comparably at the interior regions as well. This is illustrated in exhaustive experiments 
% for point tracking applications on benchmark tracking datasets.
on real-world datasets.

<p>Feature Detection and Matching approaches perform reasonably in the interior
of objects, they perform quite poorly on the object boundaries [1].
This can be attributed to two reasons.  First, the detectors rely on fixed (scalable) image patches which 
may straddle object boundaries and depth discontinuities and a change in these can lead to a change in the detected object.</p>

<p>
Second, even if a boundary point is detected at the same location w.r.t. one of the objects,
matching is very difficult as the part in the patch belonging to the other object changes.

<p>
We utilize level lines (curves connecting points with the same intensity) for this purpose by noting
that the boundaries of objects are typically traced by such level lines, which
often move with the object (Figure 2).
By detecting turns/corners on level lines that do not change much with intensity variations (stability property), discriminative points can
be found.    
We refer to such points as Corners 
on Maximally-stable Level Line Segments (CoMaL).  Furthermore, this level line itself typically separates the two objects in the case of 
object boundaries and thus, we match the portions on either side of this curve separately and take the higher score of the two.  This
makes the matching method robust even in the boundary regions.

Several detectors have used level lines in the past~\cite{cao:2005}, the most popular among them being %level line based detector is 
the Maximally Stable Extremal Regions(MSER) detector~\cite{matas:2002}.
However, since MSER considers only {\em small} closed level lines and throws away the information in longer level lines in order
to preserve the locality of a feature, it typically returns very few points and is not a popular choice for many other detection and matching
applications where one needs to obtain a sufficient number of points
